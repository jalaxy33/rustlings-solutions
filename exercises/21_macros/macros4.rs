// Hint
// You only need to add a single character to make this compile.

// The way macros are written, it wants to see something between each "macro arm",
// so it can separate them.

// That's all the macro exercises we have in here, but it's barely even scratching
// the surface of what you can do with Rust's macros. For a more thorough
// introduction, you can have a read through 'The Little Book of Rust Macros':
