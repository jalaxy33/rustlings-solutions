fn main() {
    let number = "T-H-R-E-E"; // Don't change this line
    println!("Spell a number: {}", number);

    // TODO: Fix the compiler error by changing the line below without renaming the variable.
    let number = 3;
    println!("Number plus two is: {}", number + 2);
}

// Hint
// In `variables4` we already learned how to make an immutable variable mutable
// using a special keyword. Unfortunately this doesn't help us much in this
// exercise because we want to assign a different typed value to an existing
// variable. Sometimes you may also like to reuse existing variable names because
// you are just converting values to different types like in this exercise.

// Fortunately Rust has a powerful solution to this problem: 'Shadowing'!
// You can read more about 'Shadowing' in the book's section 'Variables and
// Mutability':
// https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#shadowing

// Try to solve this exercise afterwards using this technique.
