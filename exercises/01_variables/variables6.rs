// Hint
// We know about variables and mutability, but there is another important type of
// variable available: constants.

// Constants are always immutable. They are declared with the keyword `const`
// instead of `let`.

// The type of Constants must always be annotated.

// Read more about constants and the differences between variables and constants
// under 'Constants' in the book's section 'Variables and Mutability':
// https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#constants
