fn main() {
    // TODO: Change the line below to fix the compiler error.
    let x = 10;

    if x == 10 {
        println!("x is ten!");
    } else {
        println!("x is not ten!");
    }
}

// Hint
// The compiler message is saying that Rust can't infer the type that the
// variable binding `x` has with what is given here.

// What happens if you annotate the first line in the `main` function with a type
// annotation?

// What if you give `x` a value?

// What if you do both?

// What type should `x` be, anyway?

// What if `x` is the same type as `10`? What if it's a different type?
