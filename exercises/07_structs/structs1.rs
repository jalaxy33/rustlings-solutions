// Hint
// Rust has more than one type of struct. Three actually, all variants are used to
// package related data together.

// There are regular structs. These are named collections of related data stored in
// fields.

// Tuple structs are basically just named tuples.

// Finally, unit structs. These don't have any fields and are useful for generics.

// In this exercise, you need to complete and implement one of each kind.
