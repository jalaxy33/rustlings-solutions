// Tests are important to ensure that your code does what you think it should
// do.

    n % 2 == 0

    // You can optionally experiment here.

    use crate::is_even;

    #[test]
    fn you_can_assert() {

        assert!(is_even(10));

// Hint
// `assert!` is a macro that needs an argument. Depending on the value of the
// argument, `assert!` will do nothing (in which case the test will pass) or
// `assert!` will panic (in which case the test will fail).

// So try giving different values to `assert!` and see which ones compile, which
// ones pass, and which ones fail :)

// If you want to check for `false`, you can negate the result of what you're
// checking using `!`, like `assert!(!â€¦)`.
