// Hint
// `JoinHandle` is a struct that is returned from a spawned thread:
// https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.spawn.html

// A challenge with multi-threaded applications is that the main thread can
// finish before the spawned threads are done.
// https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch16-01-threads.html#waiting-for-all-threads-to-finish-using-join-handles

// Use the `JoinHandle`s to wait for each thread to finish and collect their
// results.
