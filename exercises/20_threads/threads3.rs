// Hint
// An alternate way to handle concurrency between threads is to use an `mpsc`
// (multiple producer, single consumer) channel to communicate.

// With both a sending end and a receiving end, it's possible to send values in
// one thread and receive them in another.

// Multiple producers are possible by using `clone()` to create a duplicate of the
// original sending end.
