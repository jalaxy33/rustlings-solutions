// Hint
// The difference between this one and the previous ones is that the first line
// of `fn fill_vec` that had `let mut vec = vec;` is no longer there. You can,
// instead of adding that line back, add `mut` in one place that will change
// an existing binding to be a mutable binding instead of an immutable one :)
