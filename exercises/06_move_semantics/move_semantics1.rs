// Hint
// So you've got the "cannot borrow `vec` as mutable, as it is not declared as
// mutable" error on the line where we push an element to the vector, right?

// The fix for this is going to be adding one keyword, and the addition is NOT on
// the line where we push to the vector (where the error is).

// Try accessing `vec0` after having called `fill_vec()`. See what happens!
