// Hint
// When running this exercise for the first time, you'll notice an error about
// "borrow of moved value". In Rust, when an argument is passed to a function and
// it's not explicitly returned, you can't use the original variable anymore.
// We call this "moving" a variable. When we pass `vec0` into `fill_vec`, it's
// being "moved" into `vec1`, meaning we can't access `vec0` anymore.

// You could make another, separate version of the data that's in `vec0` and
// pass it to `fill_vec` instead. This is called cloning in Rust.
