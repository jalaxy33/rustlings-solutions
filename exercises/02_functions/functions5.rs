// TODO: Fix the function body without changing the signature.
fn square(num: i32) -> i32 {
    num * num

fn main() {
    let answer = square(3);
    println!("The square of 3 is {answer}");
}

// Hint
// This is a really common error that can be fixed by removing one character.
// It happens because Rust distinguishes between expressions and statements:
// Expressions return a value based on their operand(s), and statements simply
// return a `()` type which behaves just like `void` in C/C++.

// We want to return a value with the type `i32` from the `square` function, but
// it is returning the type `()`.

// There are two solutions:
// 1. Add the `return` keyword before `num * num;`
// 2. Remove the semicolon `;` after `num * num`
