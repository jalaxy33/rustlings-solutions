// Hint
// While you could use a destructuring `let` for the tuple here, try
// indexing into it instead, as explained in the last example of the
// 'Data Types -> The Tuple Type' section of the book:
// https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#the-tuple-type
// Now, you have another tool in your toolbox!
